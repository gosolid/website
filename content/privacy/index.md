Please note that this site uses commercial Web Analytics tools such as [Statcounter](https://statcounter.com/about/legal/), [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/) and [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to analyse web traffic from a variety of sources and protect the Diary from nefarious actors.

All use of data falls within GDPR regulations and has prior consent through this consent banner.

Should you wish the removal of your data from these analytics tools, please contact me on [hello@gosolid.dev](mailto:hello@gosolid.dev) and ask for your data to be removed, I will endeavour to work with you to remove your data from these platforms. In addition to this you should not click Accept above, nor visit the content on this website.

Should you wish to find out more about blocking popular web analytics tools such as Statcounter and Google Analytics, search Google for _Analytics Blockers_ for your browser, and please ensure you get a reputable brand.

Further to analytics, the Diary uses something known as _localStorage_ available to any website in your browser to assist you in reading content which is newly available, which you haven't already read. This information is not tracked by the analytics tools, and is kept only within your local browser.

This website does not have access to anything else on your browser, nor computer, as this is made impossible by modern web standards. For clarity, if you feel you need to step out of this website, please just read a respectable journal on web security and common practices on the web, directed at the average user.
